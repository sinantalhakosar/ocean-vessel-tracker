# PROJECT OCEAN - FE - Solution

In this document I will explain somethings more detailed item by item

- Problems: I decided to leave some problem solutions since they require more research and implementation to avoid time-sink because its an interview and we can discuss possible solutions during the interview. I made some research regarding to the problems and include some proposals inside `README.md` files of projects

- Modified the `tsconfig.json` to make imports from absolute path

- Methods:
1. `services/FileUploadService`: `upload`: While uploading the data, some fields are unnecessary for this project, so I decided to remove them after collecting it from user

-Environment Variables: At first, I put MapBox `API_KEY` inside the component for easiness, but after that I put them inside `.env` file which actually needs be implemented at first, since my commit history is visible, I changed the `API_KEY` and removed the old one. (⌐■_■)

- Keeping things more clean: Prettier can be implemented, but only before commit, some developers setting it on save and it is really annoying to see changes when I hit save ﴾͡๏̯͡๏﴿ O'RLY?

- Future Work: I put `What can be improved` section because I really liked the project and spend time to think about what can be done better and further (ง'̀-'́)ง
